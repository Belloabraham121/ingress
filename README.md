## Ingress — Unified On‑Chain Investing, Staking, and Swaps

Ingress is a modern, user‑friendly DeFi application that brings token swaps, yield‑earning vaults, and staking pools into a single, cohesive experience. It’s designed for everyday users who want transparent yields and fast, low‑fee transactions, and for institutions that need a clean, auditable flow for digital asset operations.

### Why Ingress

- **All‑in‑one**: Swap tokens, stake for rewards, and allocate into vaults in one place.
- **Fast and low‑cost**: Built with performance and low fees in mind.
- **Trust‑by‑design**: On‑chain smart contracts, verifiable rewards, and transparent accounting.
- **User‑centric**: Clear portfolio views, intuitive actions, and meaningful insights.

### What You Can Do

- **Swap tokens instantly**: Execute on‑chain swaps with a simple, familiar UX.
- **Stake for rewards**: Choose from multiple staking pools with clear APRs and lock terms.
- **Deposit into vaults**: Allocate stablecoins and tokens into strategy vaults for automated yield.
- **Track your portfolio**: See balances, positions, and transaction history in one dashboard.
- **Manage wallet & transfers**: Connect your wallet, move tokens, and view confirmations.

### Key Features at a Glance

- **Clean Dashboard**: High‑signal overview of holdings, allocated capital, and rewards.
- **Token Swap**: AMM‑style swapping with slippage controls and detailed transaction previews.
- **Staking Pools**: Multiple pools, time‑bound or flexible, with clear emissions and claim flows.
- **Vaults**: Stablecoin and token vaults for automated strategies and reward accrual.
- **Transaction History**: Human‑readable activity with statuses and references.
- **Security & Controls**: Non‑custodial architecture, audited patterns, and standard safeguards.

  participant U as User
  participant FE as Frontend (Next.js)
  participant BE as Backend (API)
  participant SC as Exchange Contract

  U->>FE: Select tokens, amount, slippage
  FE->>BE: Quote request
  BE-->>FE: Price, route, fees
  U->>FE: Confirm & sign
  FE->>SC: Submit swap txn
  SC-->>FE: Txn receipt
  FE-->>U: Success state + updated balances
