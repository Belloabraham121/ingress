# Quick Fix Summary - Paystack Test Bank

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### The Error You Saw

```
'Dedicated NUBAN is not available for your business'
```

This happened because:

- You were trying to use `wema-bank` or `titan-paystack`
- These require Paystack business approval and verification
- Your test account doesn't have this feature enabled yet

### The Solution

✅ **Changed default bank to `test-bank`** - works immediately with test keys!

---

## 📝 What Changed in the Code

### 1. Bank Account Controller

**File:** `src/controllers/bankAccount.controller.ts`

```typescript
// Before
const defaultBank = preferredBank || "wema-bank"; // ❌ Requires approval

// After
const defaultBank = preferredBank || "test-bank"; // ✅ Works immediately
```

### 2. Available Banks Endpoint

Now returns test-bank as the first option:

```json
{
  "name": "Test Bank (Testing Only)",
  "code": "test-bank",
  "slug": "test-bank",
  "description": "Use this for testing with test API keys"
}
```

### 3. Documentation Updated

- API_DOCUMENTATION.md
- bank-account-examples.http
- All test examples now use `test-bank`

---

## 🧪 How to Test Now

### Step 1: Register a User

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "firstName": "Test",
    "lastName": "User",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "password123"
  }'
```

Save the `token` from the response.

### Step 2: Create Bank Account

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/bank-account/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -d '{
    "bvn": "12345678901",
    "firstName": "Test",
    "lastName": "User",
    "phone": "08012345678",
    "preferredBank": "test-bank"
  }'
```

✅ **This should work now!**

You'll receive a test account number that you can use for testing.

### Step 3: Simulate a Payment

1. Go to [Paystack Test Dashboard](https://dashboard.paystack.com/#/test)
2. Use the "Simulate Payment" tool
3. Enter your test account number
4. Enter amount (in kobo: 5000 = ₦50.00)
5. Your webhook will receive the notification
6. Balance updates automatically
